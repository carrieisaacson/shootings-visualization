# Mass Shooting Fatalities in the US

This is a work in progress. In its current form it is an animated bubble map of shooting fatalities in the United States between 1980 and 2015, using data from the Stanford Mass Shootings of America (MSA) database. This visualization was created using D3 and topojson.

Next I will be adding interactivity, allowing the user to stop the animation on a selected year and adding tooltips to provide additional details about an incident.
